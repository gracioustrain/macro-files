ok so basically i dug through my files and found out i have a TON of old macros. and i decided, ima make these public! so here it is, the ultimate level macro repository, with tons of levels. ill def make a V2 with more macros in the future. and also, gdr goes with iCreate pro or Prism Menu, while xd goes with xDBot. use these macros to your liking!
